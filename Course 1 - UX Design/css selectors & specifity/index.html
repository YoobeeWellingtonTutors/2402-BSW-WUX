  <!-- This code demo is designed to illustrate CSS specificity and selectors, including advanced selectors, in a clear and practical manner. These concepts are crucial for web developers to understand as they determine how styles are applied to HTML elements.

Key Concepts:

CSS Specificity:

Explain that CSS specificity determines which CSS rule is applied to an element when multiple rules conflict.

Discuss the hierarchy of specificity: inline styles > IDs > classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes > elements.

Emphasize the importance of understanding specificity to avoid unexpected styling behavior.
